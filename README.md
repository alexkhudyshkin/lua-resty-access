    server {
    listen 80;
    servername domain.local;
    location / {
      
#REQUIREMENT: resolver and ca certificate directives are needed for external communication.
        resolver 8.8.8.8;
        lua_ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt;

#REQUIREMENT: Call method Protect of resty.access object using access_by_lua* directive to activate access restriction.
        access_by_lua_block {
          local access = require'resty.access'
          local site = access:new()
           
#Add email addresses whose owners are permit to enter this server or location. Provide this email in auth form to get your code.
          site:permitEmail({email = "john@snow.winter"})
          
#Or you can permit the whole domain. "*" - works as wildcard here (works in other cases too, like "teamA.*@gmail.com").
          site:permitEmail({email = "*@snow.winter"})
          
#If you want to prevent email enumeration you can setup username based authentication. Provide username in auth form to get code on related email address.
          site:permitUser({username="john", email="john@snow.winter"})
          
          #Launch module
          site:protect()
         }

       proxy_pass http://app1.domain.local;
     }
   }
}
``` 
## Optional configuration
If you want to change access time and persistence or cookie name prefix you can use sessionConfig method.
```shell
site:sessionConfig({cookie_prefix = "luarestyaccess_", access_persistent = false , access_time = 3600})
```
If you want to keep users authenticated after configuration reload, specify static secret using access_secret key.

```shell
site:sessionConfig({access_secret = 623q4hR325t36VsCD3g567922IC0073T})
```
If you want grant access to the whole domain specify it's name using cookie_domain key.
```shell
site:sessionConfig({cookie_domain = "domain.local"})
```
If you want to process emails through your own smtp server you can use emailConfig method.
```shell
site:emailConfig({
  mode = "smtp", 
  host= "smtp.gmail.com", 
  port = 587, 
  tls = true,
  username = "user@gmail.com",
  password = "qwerty123"  
})
